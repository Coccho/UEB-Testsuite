# gesamt tests

Here are a couple of tests files that test gesamt with the framework
provided by the LVA.

# Usage

We assume here that a `make` in the folder `~/abgabe/gesamt` will create a
binary called `gesamt` (as wanted by the assignment).

1. Copy the files from this directory into `~/test/gesamt` _(this is already the case if you have followed the instructions on the main page)_
2. Run the tests with: `/usr/ftp/pub/ubvl/test/gesamt/test`

# Contribution

When creating new tests, please use the following naming convention:
`{username}_{number}.{type}`
(e.g. `Coccho_03.1`), in order to avoid conflicts.

If you add tests please consider pushing them upstream with a PR so that other
students can benefit from them ðŸ˜‰
